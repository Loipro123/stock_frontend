# Front-End Code Structure

## Overview

This section provides a high-level overview of the front-end architecture and the purpose of major components.

### Architecture

Explain the overall architecture, such as whether it follows a monolithic or microservices approach.

## Folder Structure

Describe the organization of your React application's folders and key files.

### /src

- `/components`: Contains reusable React components.
- `/containers`: Higher-level components that manage state and connect to Redux.
- `/pages`: Top-level components representing different pages or views.
- `/styles`: Global styles, themes, or utility classes.
- `/utils`: Utility functions and helper modules.

### /public

- Static assets like images, fonts, and the `index.html` file.

## Components

- Navigation links and user-related information.

### `HomePage`

- Landing page of the application.
- Shows featured content or highlights.

### `PostList`

- Renders a list of posts.
- Used in multiple views.

## State Management

Explain how state is managed in your application.

- **Local State:** Used for component-specific state.
- **Context API:** For sharing global state among components.
- **Redux (Optional):** State management library for complex state needs.

## Routing

Document how routing is handled in your React application.

- `react-router-dom` used for declarative routing.
- Routes defined in `/src/routes.js`.

## Styling

Describe the styling approach, including any CSS preprocessors or styling libraries used.

- CSS Modules for local component styling.
- Global styles defined in `/styles`.

## External Libraries

List and briefly describe any external libraries or packages used in your React application.
